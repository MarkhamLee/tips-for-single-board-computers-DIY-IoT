Note: these are based on my experiences running the device on [headless Armbian](https://www.armbian.com/orange-pi-zero-2/)


* LAN worked just fine, but I couldn't get Wi-Fi to work no matter what tried, the first time you try to to configure it via armbian-config you'll be able to see the available Wi-Fi networks but you won't be able to connect to any of them. On subsequent attempts you usually won't be able to see any available networks, as if the Wi-Fi card just stops working. However, there is an easy fix: just get a USB Wi-Fi dongle and you'll be able to go into armbian-config, see the available networks and connect to them. The drawback is that you'll use up the available USB port, but depending on your use case that might not be a problem. 
* This small device runs hot if you try to push it any sort of intense work-load, like say testing it with an ML workload or with the Phoronix testing suite. I.e. while you can run various Phoronix tests on a Raspberry Pi 4B or Orange Pi 3B without a fan and the device won't shut down, the Zero 2 will definitely shutdown. The small case that came with my device doesn't have a fan, nor is it big enough to support one, so I often had to run it by just precariously connecting a fan and leaning it on the USB and LAN ports.
