# Tips and Tricks for Single Board Computers & DIY IoT Devices 

I started playing around with single board computers over the summer, starting with the Raspberry Pi and then later trying out Orange Pi and Libre LePotato devices. While getting some things to work was fairly easy, I did run some difficulties here and there that took a bit of research to figure and/or I figured out a solution on my own. This repo is just meant as a place to store my notes/experience working with these devices in case someone finds them useful/spare someone the trouble of having to sift through 5011 blogs, Reddit posts and YouTube videos to figure (for example) out how to get WiFi working on a Orange Pi Zero 2. 

Note: use the advice in this repo at your own risk, I guarantee nothing, this is just me recording my own experiences in case they help someone. 

I'm also going to include some data here on performance, benchmarking and attempts to use it for various uses cases, and how I solved any problems along the way.
