# Orange Pi Five Plus - NVME boot & other tips and tricks

Note: use the advice in this repo at your own risk, I guarantee nothing, this is just me recording my own experiences in case they help someone. 

The Orange Pi is a classic case of a Raspberry Pi Clone that surpasses it from a hardware perspective (easily), but lags a bit software wise. It took me a bit to get the NVME boot setup and I also ran into some other issues that at one point had me thinking that the unit was damaged, aggregating the things I learned here so the next person has an easier time. I didn't really have anywhere else to aggregate the data, so I figured this was as good a place as any, 

I'm also going to include some data here on performance and attempts to use it for various uses cases, and how I solved any problems along the way.
